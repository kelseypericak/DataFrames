# DataFrames

This is a good resource to use if you want to create a data frame with python. It is step one before analyzing or presenting data. The script also shows how to create a dictionary and lists using a data frame. 

Four methods are shown.

Method 1: List input

Method 2: Dictionary input

Method 3: Unioned lists input

Method 4: SQL input

If you run the script then you will see examples of each input and its output. The SQL method has no print output since no database set up was done.

I used a small sample of data mined from the Sephora Canada website to create the examples. I may use the same data in future repositories for simplicity and continuity.

Pandas and Tabulate are imported. Tabulate is not necessary but it "pretty" presents for a nicer appearance.
